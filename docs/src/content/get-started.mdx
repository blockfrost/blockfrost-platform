# Getting started

Before we start, there are several prerequisites you will need:

- ✅ A running mainnet (production) instance of cardano-node with a public IP address.
  - If you are an SPO, we recommend running Blockfrost platform on one of your relays.
  - Otherwise, to install and run your instance, refer to the official [Cardano node documentation](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/cardano-node/installing-cardano-node).
  - As an alternative, you can install and run the [Daedalus full-node wallet](https://daedaluswallet.io/).
- ✅ A reward address with the Icebreaker NFT License (provided by the Blockfrost team upon acceptance to the program).
- ✅ A secret for your Icebreaker account (also provided by the Blockfrost team).

  If you want to run the backend as your own instance, use the solitary mode
  (`--solitary` command line option) to avoid joining the Blockfrost cluster.
