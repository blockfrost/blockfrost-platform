# Roadmap

At Cardano, we enjoy structuring roadmaps into distinct eras, and we applied the same approach at Blockfrost.

### Icebreaker era

The Icebreakers Era enables SPOs and other node operators to join the centralized Blockfrost cluster, earning rewards for sharing their infrastructure and advancing Blockfrost's decentralization.

### Hopper era

In the Hopper Era, the goal is to implement a decentralized pay-per-use API billing system. Icebreakers will receive payments through micro-payment channels, while customers will also open payment channels to facilitate transactions.

In solitary mode, when the platform operates outside the cluster, customers should be able to open a payment channel directly with the platform.

### Cayley and Liskov eras

There eras are still in research and futher community discussion is required.

## Github

We track all the milestones within the roadmap on [Github](https://github.com/orgs/blockfrost/projects/17/views/1) ([roadmap view](https://github.com/orgs/blockfrost/projects/17/views/2)).
