# Blockfrost Platform community budget proposal

Blockfrost is a powerful API platform that gives anyone access to the Cardano Blockchain and functionality without the need to run your own Node.

Our API is designed with developers in mind, and offers tools that remove the complexity of direct node interactions, so anyone can start building on Cardano and launch projects on an afforable, stable and user-friendly framework. 

Blockfrost was originally developed by Five Binaries and is now maintained under the IOG Umbrella.

## Decentralizing Blockfrost
 
The demand for a reliable infrastructure and tools that support development is what lead to the creating of Blockfrost. If you have interacted witht he Cardano Blockchain, there is a good chance you were interacting with Blockfrost in the background. 

But this level of adoption has come with some trade-offs. At it's peak, Blockfrost was handling over 50% of all on-chain transactions on Cardano. We recognize this concentration is in contrast to the decentralized nature of the blockchain, and have actively been working to decentralize Blockfrost for the benefit of the Cardano community. 

Together with Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) and node operators, we have started the initial phase of what we call the Icebreakers era, an incentivized program designed to decentralize Cardano data access and reward the incredible node operator community.

### The Icebreakers

The Icebreakers is decentralized network of endpoints that allow developers to access Cardano data through a set of reliable node operators, instead of relying on a single centralized source. 

By joining the Icebreaker program, SPOs and other Cardano node operators can monetize their existing infrastructure by processing API requests as part of the Blockfrost network. 


## Deliverables

To ensure transparency and to prevent vendor lock-in, we are open-sourcing all components of the deliverables. This includes the infrastructure, libraries and documentation.

Our primary focus on two key projects: The Blockfrost Platform and the Blockfrost Gateway. Both are designed to expand the capabilities of the Icebreaker network. 

### Blockfrost Platform

The Blockfrost platform is a next-generation backend designed to run on existing SPO relays, utilizing existing resources and rewarding operators with a share of Blockfrost's current revenue by serving our existing customers.

### Blockfrost Gateway

The Blockfrost gateway is the entry point for individual SPOs running the Blockfrost platform. Through the gateway, SPOs can receive requests from Blockfrost users. In return for processing these requests, they earn a share of the revenue. 

With the Blockfrost Gateway, anyone can run their own Blockfrost instance with their own platform. We plan to use Hydra to open micro-payment channels between parties, enabling them to exchange ADA or other tokens for their services.  

We are also developing the Solitary mode, which is designed for teams that require full ownership of their enviroment. Developers and enterprise customers can deploy a customized and independent Blockfrost instance with complete control of the infrastructure, uptime and security.  
  

## KPIs

Our proposal follows the milestones outlined in the roadmap below. In addition, we commit to the following KPIs: 

* At least 100 active Icebreakers by end of year, 2025
* 100% of transactions submitted through Blockfrost will be handled by the Icebreakers by end of year, 2025
* Quarterly updates provided on the SPO call
* Monthly community development call


## Roadmap & Timelines

The Blockfrost [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/blockfrost/projects/17/views/1) ([roadmap view](https://github.com/orgs/blockfrost/projects/17/views/2)) is publically available on our Github and has been structured into distinct eras.


All milestones are clearly documented and tracked on our Github roadmap to promote accountability and transparancy. 

#### Icebreakers era

* [Icebreakers: Blockfrost platform initial release](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-platform/issues/305)
* [Icebreakers: Transaction submission endpoint](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-platform/issues/274)
* [Icebreakers: Platform gateway](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-platform/issues/276)
* [Icebreakers: Onboarding](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-platform/issues/284)
* [Icebreakers: Live ledger endpoints](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-platform/issues/275)
* [Icebreakers: Infrastructure deployment](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-platform/issues/281)
* [Icebreakers: Data nodes support](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-platform/issues/279)
* [Icebreakers: Conformance testing](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-platform/issues/304)
* [Icebreakers: Caching and invalidation](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-platform/issues/280)

#### Hopper era

* [Hopper: Research into payments channels between the platform and the consumer](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-platform/issues/287)
* [Hopper: Hydra payment channels between platform and gateway](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-platform/issues/277)
* [Hopper: Hydra payment channel between gateway and consumer](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-platform/issues/278)


## Position with the Cardano Vision and Roadmap for 2025

In March, the majority of DReps voted to adopt the strategic document [Cardano Vision and Roadmap for 2025](https://adastat.net/governances/56f39054758f1a3cedc1de9225d66bf270b62dfdbfbc5399f1d6d43aceffc63600).

Our proposal directly addresses the document's item:

  "Decentralize data API services to reduce reliance on centralized providers and empower SPOs."
  
We are decentralizing the Blockfrost API and increasing the SPO incentives, at the same time.

## Proposed budget

The majority of our budget is allocated to developer salaries. We are requesting an annual budget of $120,000  to support one full-time employee (FTE).

Our total funding request from the treasury is $650,000, which is equivalent to approximately 988,708 ADA based on the current rate of 0.65 USD per ADA.

### Team

The team that is working on the deliverble is as follows:

* [Marek](https://github.com/mmahut): Primary project lead (part-time)
* [Beatrice](https://github.com/opacular): Community engagement lead and onboarding (part-time)
* [Vladimir](https://github.com/vladimirvolek): Gateway lead
* [Michal](https://github.com/michalrus): Platform lead
* [Sefa](https://github.com/ginnun): Caching lead
* [Bart](https://github.com/bslabiak): Conformance testing lead


This amounts to total of 5 FTEs.

### Audit

Following the completion of the Icebreaker and Hopper eras, we plan to conduct a security audit of the developed code by a trusted third party. We estimate the cost of this audit to be $50,000.


## Community Engagement

As part of the budget process, we plan to host several recorded community calls for DReps and other community members to discuss this proposal. 

Records of these calls will be posted below. 

If you have questions that is not addressed in our FAQ or covered in this document, feel free to reach out to the team through our support channels: 

* Discord: [IOG's technical Discord](https://discord.gg/3dHCe6X88f)
* E-mail: support@blockfrost.io
* Twitter/X: [@Blockfrost_io](https://x.com/Blockfrost_io)

## FAQ

We have collected questions from the community and listed them here. 

* Can I also contribute to these efforts?
  * Definitely! All the deliverables are open-source and we welcome everyone who want to contribute to open an issue on our Github.
* Didn't IOG already post their budget? Why you are not including there?
  * IOE (Input Output Engineering) is a different entity than Blockfrost, therefore we are proposing our own budget.

*Please note that this is a live document and is subject to change.*
