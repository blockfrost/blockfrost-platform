# Configuring the platform

If this is your first time, you can use the `--init` flag to generate your configuration file.
For example, it can look like the following:

```
$ blockfrost-platform --init
> Run in solitary mode? No
> Enable metrics? Yes
> Which network are you connecting to? Mainnet
> Mode? Compact
> What should be the log level? Debug
> Enter the server IP address: 0.0.0.0
> Enter the port number: 3000
> Enter path to Cardano node socket: /Users/blockfrost/Library/Application Support/Daedalus Mainnet/cardano-node.socket
> Enter the reward address: addr1qyppgpfznd04jxfmc7mq53nt8pjayjzv854xw2usavwgsrzegm73yx3pu8q4egayq3l5lz8suwylrq4t4y4tc6qlv6tqrvq6qw
> Enter the icebreakers secret: 1234567890

Config has been written to "/Users/blockfrost/Library/Application Support/blockfrost-platform/config.toml"
```

Unless you know what you are doing, we recommend that you keep the default settings.
However, the Cardano node socket, the reward address, and the secret will be unique to your specific setup.

The example above is from macOS.
On Linux, you will find the configuration file at this location: 
- `~/.config/blockfrost-platform/config.toml`
