# Running the platform using Docker

Once you have the Docker image on your machine from the previous installation
section, you can run it using:

```bash
docker run -it --init --rm \
           -p 3000:3000 \
           -v /home/user/my_node.socket:/var/run/node.socket \
              blockfrost-platform --node-socket-path /var/run/node.socket \
                                  --network mainnet \
                                  --secret my_secret \
                                  --reward-address my_reward_address
```

<Callout>
  Make sure your Cardano node socket is attached as a volume, i.e. `-v
  /home/user/my_node.socket:/var/run/node.socket`.
</Callout>
<Callout>
  If you don't specify an IP address (i.e., `-p 3000:3000` instead of `-p
  127.0.0.1:3000:3000`) when publishing a container's ports, Docker publishes
  the port on all interfaces (address `0.0.0.0`) by default. These ports are
  externally accessible.

# Running the entire cluster using Docker compose

The below command will build and run the `blockfrost-platform` binary, along
with the Cardano node, using Docker Compose.

In the root folder of the repository:

```bash
# For solitary, run:
NETWORK=mainnet docker compose -p mainnet --profile solitary up --build -d

# To join the Blockfrost cluster, run:
NETWORK=mainnet SECRET=my-secret REWARD_ADDRESS=my-reward-address docker compose -p mainnet up --build -d

# Watch the build
docker compose watch
```

Please note:

- If you want to avoid running it in the background, omit the `-d` flag.
- If you want to skip building, omit the `--build` flag.
- Setting `-p mainnet` to the desired network will let you run on different networks without messing your node db. You can omit it if you plan to run on the same network always.
- You don't need to provide `--node-socket-path` since it is already handled inside `docker-compose.yml`.
