# Setting up a `systemd` service for your instance

Running it from the command line is a good way of testing your new binary; however, as you want your instance
to be up and running across the reboots, we recommend you setup a `systemd` service for it.

First, we need to create a bash script file that will serve as a startup script for the Blockfrost platform.
We can call it, for example, `start-blockfrost-platform.sh`, with content similar to the example below.

Please note that this is just an example and you need to modify it to fit your specific use case.
It won't work if you just copy and paste it.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# You can modify these variables for your specific setup
# NETWORK=mainnet
SECRET=my_icebreaker_secret_i_have_received_from_the_blockfrost_team
REWARD_ADDR=addr1_rest_of_my_reward_address_that_holds_my_nft_license_provided_by_the_blockfrost_team
CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH=/path/to/my/cardano-node/socket

/usr/local/bin/blockfrost-platform --network ${NEWORK:=mainnet} \
                                   --node-socket-path $CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH \
                                   --secret $SECRET \
                                   --reward-address $REWARD_ADDR
```

Create a new `blockfrost-platform.service` file and add this to it:

```systemd
[Unit]
Description       = Blockfrost Platform
Wants             = network-online.target
After             = network-online.target

[Service]
User              = <$USER>
Type              = simple
WorkingDirectory  = <$HOME>/blockfrost-platform
ExecStart         = /bin/bash -c '<$HOME>/cardano-platform/start-blockfrost-platform.sh'
ExecReload        = pkill -HUP blockfrost-platform
KillSignal        = SIGINT
RestartKillSignal = SIGINT
TimeoutStopSec    = 300
LimitNOFILE       = 32768
Restart           = always
RestartSec        = 5
SyslogIdentifier  = blockfrost-platform

[Install]
WantedBy          = multi-user.target
```

Next, move it to the systemd folder and set appropriate permissions.

```bash
mv blockfrost-platform.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/blockfrost-platform.service
```

Following that, you can then enable the service.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable blockfrost-platform.service
```

Let's restart the service and see if it is working.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart blockfrost-platform.service
journalctl -f -u blockfrost-platform
```

Your Blockfrost platform is now enabled within `systemd` which means it should survive even reboots. But please test it.
