## 4. What should I do if I've received the email but not the NFT?

If you've received the confirmation email but haven't received your NFT:

1. Reply directly to the confirmation email stating that you haven't received the NFT, including your wallet address for verification.

2. Contact our support team at support@blockfrost.io.

- [Configure the platform](/usage/configuration) with your NFT address and secret key
- [Run the platform](/usage/cli) either directly or as a service

## 7. Do I need confirmation after receiving the NFT to proceed?

No, you don't need additional confirmation after receiving the NFT.
