# Blockfrost platform

The Blockfrost platform transforms your Cardano node infrastructure into a high-performance JSON API endpoint.

Whether you're a Stake Pool Operator (SPO) looking to monetize your relay infrastructure, a node operator interested in joining a decentralized API network, or a developer needing a reliable local environment, the Blockfrost platform adapts to your needs through two deployment options:

- **Join the fleet**: Connect your node to the Blockfrost cluster, serving API requests as part of a decentralized network (also known as the Icebreakers programe).
- **Run independently**: Deploy your own instance with complete control to best suit your development environment or private infrastructure requirements.

As the new replacement version of our [open-source Blockfrost backend](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-backend-ryo/), this new platform brings enterprise-grade capabilities to your existing Cardano infrastructure while maintaining the straightforward deployment and maintenance you expect from production tools.
