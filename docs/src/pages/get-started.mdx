import { Callout, Table } from 'nextra/components'

## Getting started

Before we start, there are a couple of prerequisites you will need:
- ✅ A running mainnet (production) instance of cardano-node.
  - If you are an SPO, we recommend running this on one of your relays.
  - Follow [the official Cardano node documentation](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/cardano-node/installing-cardano-node) to install and run your instance otherwise.
- ✅ A reward address with the Icebreaker NFT License (provided by the Blockfrost team upon acceptance to the programme).
- ✅ A secret for your Icebreaker account (also provided by the Blockfrost team).

If you want to run the backend as your own instance, use the solitary mode (`--solitary` command line option) to avoid joining the Blockfrost cluster.
