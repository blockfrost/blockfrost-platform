# Blockfrost Icebreakers

The Icebreakers program is an incentivized testing initiative featuring a network of Cardano node operators who participate by sharing their node resources. 
These operators facilitate access to data stored on the Cardano blockchain, aiming to decentralize Blockfrost by leveraging the existing community infrastructure.

Each participating Cardano node operator installs the Blockfrost Platform software, which allows them to join the Blockfrost backend fleet and offer their resources. 
In return, they earn revenue from the data services they provide.

Blockfrost customers seamlessly access this blockchain-stored data through the Icebreakers, often without being aware of the source.
