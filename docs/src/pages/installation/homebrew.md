## Installing using Homebrew

If you are using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on your macOS (or Linux), you
just need to run:

```bash
brew install blockfrost/tap/blockfrost-platform
```

After tapping into it, you should be able to run it:

```
$ blockfrost-platform --version
blockfrost-platform 0.0.1
```
