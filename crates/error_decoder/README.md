# error decoder

This package contains external error decoder for tx submit errors. Historically used to decode and generate errors messages that are return from our API.
Now it's only used to test `pallas-hardano` based implementation and generate random test cases. `pallas-hardano` vs ledger error generating tests are also in thes crate.
Related `pallas-hardano` part initially implemented in this repository and later merged into pallas.
